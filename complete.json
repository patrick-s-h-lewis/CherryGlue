In order to improve the catalytic process, a composite film electrode is developed based on (i) carbon microparticles of 2\u201312\u00a0\u03bcm diameter to enhance charge transport and (ii) a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (here PIM-EA-TB with a BET surface area of 1027\u00a0m2\u00a0g\u22121). The latter acts as a highly rigid molecular framework for the embedded free radical catalyst with simultaneous access to aqueous phase and substrate. The resulting mechanism for the oxidation of primary alcohols is shown to switch in reaction order from first to zeroth with increasing substrate concentration consistent with a kinetically limited process with competing diffusion of charge at the polymer layer-electrode interface (here the \u201cLEk\u201d case in Albery-Hillman notation). Reactivity optimisation and screening for a wider range of primary alcohols in conjunction with DFT-based relative reactivity correlation reveals substrate hydrophobicity as an important factor for enhancing catalytic currents.

Then the results were compared with simulation results of dry CTMA-Mont. The MD simulations show that the CTMA cations form layer structures on siloxane surface and aggregate in the interlayer space. Water molecules can access part of the siloxane surface and form H-bonds with surface oxygen atoms by donating one or two of the hydrogen atoms. Thus, the water molecules close to the surface have a preferred orientation with the dipole pointing towards the surface, while in the interlayer space, the water molecules aggregate to form large clusters. The H-bonds between surface oxygen and water molecules are shown to be slightly weaker than those between water molecules. Although water molecules within interlayer space can form strong H-bonds as in bulk water the number of H-bond for each water molecule is reduced.

The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems.

In all cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in time. In $B1$ the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from that commonly assumed.

Increasing the offset in fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the heterostructure interfaces.

To unravel this complex behavior, we have examined the effects of surfactant loading on the interlayer structure and sorption behaviors of organoclays using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The sorption behavior of phenol on three cetyltrimethylammonium intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mt) with CTMA loading levels of 0.33, 1.0, and 1.66 times of the Mt's cation exchange capacity (CEC), was studied. The results demonstrated that CTMA aggregates were the main sorption domains for phenol molecules, consistent with a partition process. The interlayer structure of CTMA-Mt influences the sorption affinity of phenol. CTMA aggregates increased in size with increasing loading level, creating larger sorption domains for phenol uptake. On the other hand, high CTMA loading level decreased the sorption affinity of CTMA-Mt (with 1.66 CEC loading) toward phenol by increasing the packing density and cohesive characteristic of the aggregates. In addition, the siloxane surfaces of Mt and the hydrated inorganic ions (Ca2+ or Br\u2212) showed specific interactions with phenol molecules by forming H-bond. The oxygen atoms on siloxane surface and water molecules around Br\u2212 serve as H-bond acceptor while water molecules around Ca2+ serve as H-bond donor, corresponding to polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) results. The modelling results correlate well with the experimental findings, and further reveal that the sorption affinity strongly depends on the size and packing density of surfactant aggregates. In addition, H-bond interactions should be considered as well in the sorption of OCs containing particular groups.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mineral Physics and Material Research & Development, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                "], "authors": ["H He", "J Zhu", "SC Parker", "R Zhu", "M Molinari", "Q Zhou"], "date": "21 May 2015"},

Aryl ethynyl groups are attached at the 3,6-position of carbazole (aryl = 4-dimethylaminophenyl for sensor 1 or phenyl for sensor 2). Sensor 3 is without 3,6-substitutions. The phenylboronic acid moiety is attached at the 9-position (N-atom) of the carbazole in these sensors. We found that 1 and 3 are d-PET sensors (fluorophore as the electron donor, supported by DFT/TDDFT calculations), which show diminished emission at acidic pH but intensified emission at neutral/basic pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PET (fluorophore as the electron acceptor) sensors, e.g., 2, which shows intensified emission at acidic pH but diminished emission at neutral pH. The fluorescence modulation efficiency of the d-PET effect of the new sensors, i.e., the emission intensity enhancement upon switching from acidic pH to neutral pH, is up to 10-fold, which is greatly improved compared to our previous d-PET sensors (ca. 3-fold). The efficient d-PET effect of the new sensors is attributed to the proper orientation of the electron donor/acceptor; i.e., the dipole moment and the transition moment (the direction of PET) of the new sensors are oriented in the same direction, and the dipole moment values of the new sensors along the vector direction of the PET are larger than that of the reported d-PET sensors. Selective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxyl carboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid, was achieved with the d-PET sensors, and a novel fluorescence transduction profile of enhancement/ diminishment for chemoselectivity was observed. Herein we propose that the orientation of the electron donor/acceptor may significantly affect the fluorescence modulation efficiency of the PET effect; this discovery will be important for the future design of PET sensors with improved fluorescence transduction efficiencies.", "affiliations": ["\u00a7 State Key Laboratory of Molecular Reaction Dynamics, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, P.

The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm\u2212Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (kET, Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6. The effect of pH as well as the bonding with analytes on the emission of the sensors were rationalized using DFT/TDDFT calculations. We believe that rational sensor design aided by DFT/TDDFT calculations as well as using free energy changes and electron transfer rate constants to study the emission properties of PeT sensors will become an essential tool in the design of new fluorophores or fluorescent sensors with predetermined photophysical properties.", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, P.O.

The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without damage to the electrode surface. The electrode is immersed into aqueous electrolyte media, and voltammetric responses for the oxidation of DDPD are obtained. In order to further improve the current responses, 20\u2005wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array. Voltammetric signals are consistent with the oxidation of DDPD and the associated transfer of perchlorate anions (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M NaClO4) or the transfer of protons (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M HClO4). From the magnitude of the current response, the DDPD content in the mineral oil can be determined down to less than 1\u2005wt% levels. Perhaps surprisingly, the reversible (or midpoint) potential for the DDPD oxidation in mineral oil (when immersed in 0.1 NaClO4) is shown to be concentration-dependent and to shift to more positive potential values for more dilute DDPD in mineral oil solutions.

Thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized with 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold electrodes, and used as a scaffold for DNA aptamer attachment through hybridization of the aptamer overhang (so-called \u201cDNA-directed immobilization aptamer sensors\u201d, DDIAS). In the approach, the complementary DNA aptamer against PSA was assembled by the probe ssDNA onto the electrode to detect PSA; or the probe ssDNA directly hybridized with a complementary DNA aptamer/PSA complex following their pre-incubation in solution, so-called \u2018on-chip\u2019 and \u2018in-solution\u2019 methods, respectively. A double stranded DNA intercalator with a ferrocenyl (Fc) redox marker was synthesized to evaluate the feasibility of the strategy. The results demonstrate that the \u2018in-solution\u2019 method offers a favourable medium (in a homogeneous solution) for the binding between the aptamer and PSA, which shows to be more efficient than the \u2018on-chip\u2019 approach.

T of PP and the \u03b2-crystal content (K\u03b2) in \u03b2-nucleated iPP/PA66 blends not only depended on the PA66 content, but also on the compatibilizer type. Addition of PP-g-MA and POE-g-MA into \u03b2-nucleated iPP/PA66 blends increased the \u03b2-crystal content; however, EVA-g-MA is not benefit for the formation of \u03b2-crystal in the compatibilized \u03b2-nucleated iPP/PA66 blend. It can be relative to the different interfacial interactions between PP and compatibilizers.

However, due to the variability of immune response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer, detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA autoantibody detection.

Polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles containing covalently bound fluorescein methacrylate and dispersed Nile Red were prepared by emulsion polymerization. The two fluorophores differentiate the fate of the polymeric vehicle on and within the skin from that of the active. Nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. In vitro skin permeation experiments were performed using dermatomed porcine skin. Post-treatment with nanoparticle formulations, the skin surface was either cleaned carefully with buffer or simply dried with tissue, and then immediately visualized by confocal microscopy. Average nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Confocal images showed that nanoparticles were located in skin \u201cfurrows\u201d and around hair follicles. Surface cleaning removed the former but not all of the latter. At the skin surface, Nile Red remained partly associated with nanoparticles, but was also released to some extent and penetrated into deeper layers of the stratum corneum (SC). In summary, polymeric nanoparticles did not penetrate beyond the superficial SC, showed some affinity for hair follicles, and released an associated \u201cactive\u201d into the skin.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); topical drug delivery", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

In this study, we have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions were evaluated for the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that the biological activities of the immobilized antibodies were dependent on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Optimal immobilization conditions were different for each antibody. Limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10\u00a0pM can reach under optimized conditions.

The thiophene moiety was used to extend the \u03c0-conjugation framework of the fluorophore in order to red-shift the fluorescence emission and, at the same time, to enhance the novel process where the fluorophore serves as the electron donor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (d-PET) of the boronic acid sensors; i.e., the background fluorescence of the sensor 1 at acidic pH is weaker compared to that at neutral or basic pH, in stark contrast to the typical a-PET boronic acid sensors (where the fluorophore serves as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process). The benefit of the d-PET boronic acid sensors is that the recognition of the hydroxylic acids can be achieved at acidic pH. We found that the thiophene moiety is an efficient \u03c0-conjugation linker and electron donor; as a result, the d-PET contrast ratio of the sensors upon variation of the pH is improved 10-fold when compared to the previously reported d-PET sensors without the thiophene moiety. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved at acid pH, and the enantioselectivity (total response KdIFd/KlIFl) is 3.3. The fluorescence enhancement (IFSample/IFBlank) of sensor 1 upon binding with tartaric acid is 3.5-fold at pH 3.0. With the fluorescent bisboronic acid sensor 1, enantioselective recognition of mandelic acid was achieved for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mandelic acid has been enantioselectively recognized using a chiral fluorescent boronic acid sensor. Chiral monoboronic acid sensor 2 and bisboronic acid sensor 3 without the thiophene moiety failed to enantioselectively recognize mandelic acid. Our findings with the thiophene-incorporated boronic acid sensors will be important for the design of d-PET fluorescent sensors for the enantioselective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxylic acids such as mandelic acid, given that it is currently a challenge to recognize these analytes with boronic acid fluorescent molecular sensors.", "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, U.

Boronic acids follow lectin functions not just in being able to bind saccharides, but in multivalent saccharide binding that enhances both affinity and selectivity. For almost a decade, efforts have been made to achieve and improve selectivity for given saccharide targets, most notably glucose, by using properly positioned boronic acids, offering multivalent interactions. Incorporation of several boronic acid groups into a covalent framework or non-covalent assembly of boronic acid are two general methods used to create such smart sensors, of which the latter resembles lectin oligomerisation that affords multivalent saccharide-binding architectures.

PS-HEMA copolymer nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, via the covalent incorporation of a small quantity of fluorescein methacrylate, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR. The fluorophore, Nile Red, was dispersed into the nanoparticles and its loading was determined by ultracentrifugation. Skin uptake was assessed in vitro following a 6 h application of the nanoparticle formulation, via stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping and confocal microscopy. Nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Progressive introduction of HEMA decreased particle hydrophobicity and reduced Nile Red loading. Uptake of Nile Red into the skin, as assessed both by the amounts extracted from the SC and by confocal microscopy, decreased as the percentage HEMA increased. Confocal microscopy confirmed that nanoparticles could not move beyond the superficial SC, but did show affinity for hair follicle openings. In conclusion, the loading of a lipophilic \u201cactive\u201d into nanoparticles, and its subsequent release when these formulations are applied topically, are sensitive to the composition and relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); tape-stripping", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "P Griffin", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

In spite of the wrapping, some Pd-catalytic processes are observed, but with pH controlling the rate.

This modular strategy to assembly chiral sensors alleviated the previous restrictions of chiral boronic acid sensors, for which the chirogenic center, fluorophore, and scaffold were integrated, thus it was difficult to optimize the molecular structures by chemical modifications. We demonstrated the potential of our new strategy by the preparation of a sensor with a larger scaffold. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect is efficient even with a large distance between the N atom and the fluorophore core. Furthermore, the rarely reported donor-PET (d-PET) effect, which was previously limited to carbazole, was extended to phenothiazine fluorophore. The contrast ratio, that is, PET efficiency of the new d-PET sensor, is increased to 8.0, compared to 2.0 with the previous carbazole d-PET sensors. Furthermore, the ethynylated phenothiazine shows longer excitation wavelength (centered at 380\u2005nm) and emission wavelength (492\u2005nm), a large Stokes shift (142\u2005nm), and high fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution (\u03a6=0.48 in MeOH/water, 3:1 v/v). Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved with the new d-PET boronic acid sensors. The enantioselectivity is up to 10 (ratio of the binding constants toward D- and L-tartaric acid, kD/kL). A consecutive fluorescence enhancement/decrease was observed, thus we propose a transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:2 as the analyte concentration increases, which is supported by mass spectra analysis. The boronic acid sensors were used for selective and sensitive recognition of disaccharides and glycosylated steroids (ginsenosides).", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024 (P.R.

Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off\u2013on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma.

The mixed phosphates Na4M3(PO4)2P2O7 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) are a fascinating new class of materials recently reported to be attractive Na ion cathodes which display low-volume changes upon cycling, indicative of long-lifetime operation. Key issues surrounding intrinsic defects, Na ion migration mechanisms, and voltage trends have been investigated through a combination of atomistic energy minimization, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory simulations. For all compositions, the most energetically favorable defect is calculated to be the Na/M antisite pair. MD simulations suggest Na+ diffusion extends across a 3D network of migration pathways with an activation barrier of 0.20\u20130.24 eV, and diffusion coefficients (DNa) of 10\u201310\u201310\u201311 cm2 s\u20131 at 325 K, suggesting good rate capability.

In this work, we reported a transverse etching process to investigate the morphological variations of single gold nanorods (GNRs). Dark-field microscopy and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy were used as complementary technologies to track the transverse etching process. Dark-field imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution could easily monitor the transverse etching process of GNRs in situ and in real time. Interactions between the scattering spectrum and the morphological variations were judiciously calculated within the dipole approximation by the Drude function. The calculated peak shift of GNRs (\u0394\u03bbmax = 17 nm) was obtained via the ratio of the long axis and short axis (aspect ratio) of GNRs from transmission electron microscopy. The average scattering peak shift (\u0394\u03bbmax = 22 nm) from Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy was in good agreement with the calculated peak shift. Monitoring the morphological variations of single GNRs enables us to track the transverse etching of GNRs at arbitrary time. This promises to be a useful method for the study of different nanomaterials and their spectral properties.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, The University of Western Ontario, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Canada N6A 5B7\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials & Department of Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, P.

In the crystals of 1 between 4.45 and 5.38 GPa adjacent molecules slide over each other and the dominant stacking interaction changes from a thiophene\u22efthiophene interaction at 4.45 GPa to a benzothiophene\u22efbenzothiophene interaction at 5.38 GPa and, within each molecule, the benzothiophene groups show a significant reorientation at the phase transition. In 2 there is a loss of molecular symmetry, concomitant with the change in space group, at the phase transition with the asymmetric unit changing from containing half a unique molecule to two independent molecules. The molecules show significant reorientations of their ring systems. The nature of the observed transition in 1 was investigated using solid-state computational methods to prove the superior thermodynamic stability of the high-pressure phase to the lower pressure phase at pressures above 5.38 GPa. Solid state UV-Vis spectroscopy of 1, over the pressure range from ambient to 15.4 GPa showed that the compound displayed piezochromism with a significant red shift in the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0* absorption band and a colour change in the crystal from colourless to red with increasing pressure.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     School of Chemistry, Joseph Black Building, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, UK\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Station I19, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, Oxfordshire, UK\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Applied Physics Department, Faculty of Science, University of Cantabria, 39005 Santander, Spain\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, Bath University, UK\r\n                                                    "], "authors": ["S Parsons", "DR Allan", "R Valiente", "S Schiffers", "PR Raithby", "CH Woodall", "SK Brayshaw"], "date": "15 November 2013"},

Then the results were compared with simulation results of dry CTMA-Mont. The MD simulations show that the CTMA cations form layer structures on siloxane surface and aggregate in the interlayer space. Water molecules can access part of the siloxane surface and form H-bonds with surface oxygen atoms by donating one or two of the hydrogen atoms. Thus, the water molecules close to the surface have a preferred orientation with the dipole pointing towards the surface, while in the interlayer space, the water molecules aggregate to form large clusters. The H-bonds between surface oxygen and water molecules are shown to be slightly weaker than those between water molecules.

To examine ionic transport and defect distributions while explicitly accounting for ion-ion correlations and lattice effects, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a model coherent fluorite heterostructure without any extrinsic defects, with a difference in standard chemical potentials of mobile fluoride ions between phases induced by an external potential. Increasing the offset in fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the heterostructure interfaces. Non-charge-neutral ``space-charge'' regions, however, extend only a few atomic spacings from the interface, suggesting a continuum model may be inappropriate. Defect distributions are qualitatively inconsistent with the predictions of the continuum mean-field model, and indicate strong lattice-mediated defect-defect interactions.

To unravel this complex behavior, we have examined the effects of surfactant loading on the interlayer structure and sorption behaviors of organoclays using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The sorption behavior of phenol on three cetyltrimethylammonium intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mt) with CTMA loading levels of 0.33, 1.0, and 1.66 times of the Mt's cation exchange capacity (CEC), was studied. The results demonstrated that CTMA aggregates were the main sorption domains for phenol molecules, consistent with a partition process. The interlayer structure of CTMA-Mt influences the sorption affinity of phenol. CTMA aggregates increased in size with increasing loading level, creating larger sorption domains for phenol uptake. On the other hand, high CTMA loading level decreased the sorption affinity of CTMA-Mt (with 1.66 CEC loading) toward phenol by increasing the packing density and cohesive characteristic of the aggregates. In addition, the siloxane surfaces of Mt and the hydrated inorganic ions (Ca2+ or Br\u2212) showed specific interactions with phenol molecules by forming H-bond. The oxygen atoms on siloxane surface and water molecules around Br\u2212 serve as H-bond acceptor while water molecules around Ca2+ serve as H-bond donor, corresponding to polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) results. The modelling results correlate well with the experimental findings, and further reveal that the sorption affinity strongly depends on the size and packing density of surfactant aggregates. In addition, H-bond interactions should be considered as well in the sorption of OCs containing particular groups.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mineral Physics and Material Research & Development, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                "], "authors": ["H He", "J Zhu", "SC Parker", "R Zhu", "M Molinari", "Q Zhou"], "date": "21 May 2015"},

Aryl ethynyl groups are attached at the 3,6-position of carbazole (aryl = 4-dimethylaminophenyl for sensor 1 or phenyl for sensor 2). Sensor 3 is without 3,6-substitutions. The phenylboronic acid moiety is attached at the 9-position (N-atom) of the carbazole in these sensors. We found that 1 and 3 are d-PET sensors (fluorophore as the electron donor, supported by DFT/TDDFT calculations), which show diminished emission at acidic pH but intensified emission at neutral/basic pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PET (fluorophore as the electron acceptor) sensors, e.g., 2, which shows intensified emission at acidic pH but diminished emission at neutral pH. The fluorescence modulation efficiency of the d-PET effect of the new sensors, i.e., the emission intensity enhancement upon switching from acidic pH to neutral pH, is up to 10-fold, which is greatly improved compared to our previous d-PET sensors (ca. 3-fold). The efficient d-PET effect of the new sensors is attributed to the proper orientation of the electron donor/acceptor; i.e., the dipole moment and the transition moment (the direction of PET) of the new sensors are oriented in the same direction, and the dipole moment values of the new sensors along the vector direction of the PET are larger than that of the reported d-PET sensors. Selective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxyl carboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid, was achieved with the d-PET sensors, and a novel fluorescence transduction profile of enhancement/ diminishment for chemoselectivity was observed. Herein we propose that the orientation of the electron donor/acceptor may significantly affect the fluorescence modulation efficiency of the PET effect; this discovery will be important for the future design of PET sensors with improved fluorescence transduction efficiencies.", "affiliations": ["\u00a7 State Key Laboratory of Molecular Reaction Dynamics, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, P.

In comparison to water, CTMA\u2013Mont is more polarizable, less polar and cohesive, and has stronger H-bond acceptor and weaker H-bond donor capacities. Using the above equation we calculated that vV and eE were the dominant solvation terms contributing to the sorption for all the OCs. MD simulations provided atomic-level insight into the interlayer structure of CTMA\u2013Mont. Phenol molecules were shown to be sorbed into the nanosized aggregates formed by CTMA alkyl chains. The hydrophobic environment within the aggregates is responsible for the sorbent\u2019s more polarizable, less polar and cohesive characteristics. CTMA\u2013Mont has strong H-bond acceptor and weak H-bond donor capacities as oxygen atoms on the siloxane surface act as H-bond acceptors for both water and OC molecules.

The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm\u2212Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (kET, Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6. The effect of pH as well as the bonding with analytes on the emission of the sensors were rationalized using DFT/TDDFT calculations. We believe that rational sensor design aided by DFT/TDDFT calculations as well as using free energy changes and electron transfer rate constants to study the emission properties of PeT sensors will become an essential tool in the design of new fluorophores or fluorescent sensors with predetermined photophysical properties.", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, P.O.

The results indicated that the addition of supported \u03b2-nucleating agent markedly increased the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP. Increasing the content of supported \u03b2-nucleating agent slightly increased the Tc, but had no influence on the melting temperatures (Tm) of \u03b2-nucleated PP. The Tc and Tm of \u03b2-nucleated PP decreased slightly with increasing the content of the support nano-CaCO3. The effects of scan rates and multiple scans with different Tmelt on the crystallization and melting behavior of PP nucleated by supported \u03b2-nucleating agent are similar to that of PP nucleated by calcium pimelate (CaHA).

The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without damage to the electrode surface.

In order to further improve the current responses, 20\u2005wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array. Voltammetric signals are consistent with the oxidation of DDPD and the associated transfer of perchlorate anions (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M NaClO4) or the transfer of protons (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M HClO4). From the magnitude of the current response, the DDPD content in the mineral oil can be determined down to less than 1\u2005wt% levels. Perhaps surprisingly, the reversible (or midpoint) potential for the DDPD oxidation in mineral oil (when immersed in 0.1 NaClO4) is shown to be concentration-dependent and to shift to more positive potential values for more dilute DDPD in mineral oil solutions.

In the approach, the complementary DNA aptamer against PSA was assembled by the probe ssDNA onto the electrode to detect PSA; or the probe ssDNA directly hybridized with a complementary DNA aptamer/PSA complex following their pre-incubation in solution, so-called \u2018on-chip\u2019 and \u2018in-solution\u2019 methods, respectively.

Protein microarrays have demonstrated to be cost-effective, high through-put and powerful tools for screening and identifying tumor markers with only minute samples. Autoantibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were shown to be relevant tumor markers. However, due to the variability of immune response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer, detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA autoantibody detection. Herein a panel of 10 proteins, including well-known tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and potential new biomarkers of breast cancer, were immobilized onto microstructured microarray under optimized conditions (spotting pH buffer, surface chemistry, blocking procedure), in order to determine an autoimmune signature of breast cancer. Sera from 29 breast cancer patients and 28 healthy donors were screened in sandwich immunoassays on the miniaturized system to detect the eventual presence of anti-TAAs autoantibodies.

Highly ordered anatase 2D-hexagonal mesoporous titania (meso-TiO2) nanoparticles with a high surface area and large pore size were fabricated. Meso-TiO2 was used as scattering particles and mixed with titania nanocrystallites at weight proportions ranging from 0 to 100%. Films made from the composites were used as scattering layers in DSSCs. The influence of meso-TiO2 proportion on the structure, morphology, and optical properties of the films were investigated. The results show that the films became more porous, with a larger surface roughness, and had higher surface areas and greater light-scattering effects when meso-TiO2 was incorporated. The performance of these scattering layers in relatively large, 1 cm2 area, DSSCs was studied to link cell performance to the detailed physical properties of the meso-TiO2/nanoparticle films.

Average nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Confocal images showed that nanoparticles were located in skin \u201cfurrows\u201d and around hair follicles. Surface cleaning removed the former but not all of the latter.

In this work, we reported a transverse etching process to investigate the morphological variations of single gold nanorods (GNRs). Dark-field microscopy and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy were used as complementary technologies to track the transverse etching process. Dark-field imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution could easily monitor the transverse etching process of GNRs in situ and in real time. Interactions between the scattering spectrum and the morphological variations were judiciously calculated within the dipole approximation by the Drude function. The calculated peak shift of GNRs (\u0394\u03bbmax = 17 nm) was obtained via the ratio of the long axis and short axis (aspect ratio) of GNRs from transmission electron microscopy. The average scattering peak shift (\u0394\u03bbmax = 22 nm) from Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy was in good agreement with the calculated peak shift. Monitoring the morphological variations of single GNRs enables us to track the transverse etching of GNRs at arbitrary time. This promises to be a useful method for the study of different nanomaterials and their spectral properties.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, The University of Western Ontario, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Canada N6A 5B7\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials & Department of Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, P.

For almost a decade, efforts have been made to achieve and improve selectivity for given saccharide targets, most notably glucose, by using properly positioned boronic acids, offering multivalent interactions. Incorporation of several boronic acid groups into a covalent framework or non-covalent assembly of boronic acid are two general methods used to create such smart sensors, of which the latter resembles lectin oligomerisation that affords multivalent saccharide-binding architectures.

The thiophene moiety was used to extend the \u03c0-conjugation framework of the fluorophore in order to red-shift the fluorescence emission and, at the same time, to enhance the novel process where the fluorophore serves as the electron donor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (d-PET) of the boronic acid sensors; i.e., the background fluorescence of the sensor 1 at acidic pH is weaker compared to that at neutral or basic pH, in stark contrast to the typical a-PET boronic acid sensors (where the fluorophore serves as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process). The benefit of the d-PET boronic acid sensors is that the recognition of the hydroxylic acids can be achieved at acidic pH. We found that the thiophene moiety is an efficient \u03c0-conjugation linker and electron donor; as a result, the d-PET contrast ratio of the sensors upon variation of the pH is improved 10-fold when compared to the previously reported d-PET sensors without the thiophene moiety. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved at acid pH, and the enantioselectivity (total response KdIFd/KlIFl) is 3.3. The fluorescence enhancement (IFSample/IFBlank) of sensor 1 upon binding with tartaric acid is 3.5-fold at pH 3.0. With the fluorescent bisboronic acid sensor 1, enantioselective recognition of mandelic acid was achieved for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mandelic acid has been enantioselectively recognized using a chiral fluorescent boronic acid sensor. Chiral monoboronic acid sensor 2 and bisboronic acid sensor 3 without the thiophene moiety failed to enantioselectively recognize mandelic acid. Our findings with the thiophene-incorporated boronic acid sensors will be important for the design of d-PET fluorescent sensors for the enantioselective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxylic acids such as mandelic acid, given that it is currently a challenge to recognize these analytes with boronic acid fluorescent molecular sensors.", "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, U.

This modular strategy to assembly chiral sensors alleviated the previous restrictions of chiral boronic acid sensors, for which the chirogenic center, fluorophore, and scaffold were integrated, thus it was difficult to optimize the molecular structures by chemical modifications. We demonstrated the potential of our new strategy by the preparation of a sensor with a larger scaffold. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect is efficient even with a large distance between the N atom and the fluorophore core. Furthermore, the rarely reported donor-PET (d-PET) effect, which was previously limited to carbazole, was extended to phenothiazine fluorophore. The contrast ratio, that is, PET efficiency of the new d-PET sensor, is increased to 8.0, compared to 2.0 with the previous carbazole d-PET sensors. Furthermore, the ethynylated phenothiazine shows longer excitation wavelength (centered at 380\u2005nm) and emission wavelength (492\u2005nm), a large Stokes shift (142\u2005nm), and high fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution (\u03a6=0.48 in MeOH/water, 3:1 v/v). Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved with the new d-PET boronic acid sensors. The enantioselectivity is up to 10 (ratio of the binding constants toward D- and L-tartaric acid, kD/kL). A consecutive fluorescence enhancement/decrease was observed, thus we propose a transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:2 as the analyte concentration increases, which is supported by mass spectra analysis.

PS-HEMA copolymer nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, via the covalent incorporation of a small quantity of fluorescein methacrylate, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR. The fluorophore, Nile Red, was dispersed into the nanoparticles and its loading was determined by ultracentrifugation. Skin uptake was assessed in vitro following a 6 h application of the nanoparticle formulation, via stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping and confocal microscopy. Nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Progressive introduction of HEMA decreased particle hydrophobicity and reduced Nile Red loading. Uptake of Nile Red into the skin, as assessed both by the amounts extracted from the SC and by confocal microscopy, decreased as the percentage HEMA increased. Confocal microscopy confirmed that nanoparticles could not move beyond the superficial SC, but did show affinity for hair follicle openings. In conclusion, the loading of a lipophilic \u201cactive\u201d into nanoparticles, and its subsequent release when these formulations are applied topically, are sensitive to the composition and relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); tape-stripping", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "P Griffin", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off\u2013on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.", "affiliations": ["\u2020 Key\r\nLaboratory for Advanced Materials and Institute of Fine Chemicals,\r\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Functional Materials Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China", "\u2021 Key\r\nLaboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education,\r\nCenter for Bionanoengineering, and Department of Chemical and Biological\r\nEngineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China", "\u22a5 Department\r\nof Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["J Tang", "X Wu", "H Tian", "TD James", "Y Shen", "X Sun", "Z Guo", "W Zhu"], "date": "13 February 2014"},

Key issues surrounding intrinsic defects, Na ion migration mechanisms, and voltage trends have been investigated through a combination of atomistic energy minimization, molecular dynamics (MD), and density functional theory simulations.

A comprehensive co-crystal screen of four fenamic acid derivatives affords a strictly limited number of co-crystals.

These parameters relate to surface chemistry and to immobilization conditions (printing buffers, washing etc.). In this study, we have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions were evaluated for the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer.

Water molecules can access part of the siloxane surface and form H-bonds with surface oxygen atoms by donating one or two of the hydrogen atoms. Thus, the water molecules close to the surface have a preferred orientation with the dipole pointing towards the surface, while in the interlayer space, the water molecules aggregate to form large clusters. The H-bonds between surface oxygen and water molecules are shown to be slightly weaker than those between water molecules. Although water molecules within interlayer space can form strong H-bonds as in bulk water the number of H-bond for each water molecule is reduced.

This assumption leads to well-known Arrhenius expressions for transport coefficients, and is equivalent to assuming diffusion is a Poisson process. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the low-temperature $B1$, $B3$, and $B4$ AgI polymorphs, we have compared rates of ion hopping with corresponding Poisson distributions to test the assumption of independent hopping in these common structure types. In all cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in time. In $B1$ the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from that commonly assumed. In low temperature $B3$ and $B4$, diffusion is characterized by concerted motion of multiple ions in short closed loops.

To examine ionic transport and defect distributions while explicitly accounting for ion-ion correlations and lattice effects, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a model coherent fluorite heterostructure without any extrinsic defects, with a difference in standard chemical potentials of mobile fluoride ions between phases induced by an external potential. Increasing the offset in fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the heterostructure interfaces. Non-charge-neutral ``space-charge'' regions, however, extend only a few atomic spacings from the interface, suggesting a continuum model may be inappropriate. Defect distributions are qualitatively inconsistent with the predictions of the continuum mean-field model, and indicate strong lattice-mediated defect-defect interactions.

The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems. DNA adsorption could not be identified in the presence of Na+ using SANS, but cryo-TEM indicates the presence of DNA between neighboring unilamellar vesicles.

Aryl ethynyl groups are attached at the 3,6-position of carbazole (aryl = 4-dimethylaminophenyl for sensor 1 or phenyl for sensor 2). Sensor 3 is without 3,6-substitutions. The phenylboronic acid moiety is attached at the 9-position (N-atom) of the carbazole in these sensors. We found that 1 and 3 are d-PET sensors (fluorophore as the electron donor, supported by DFT/TDDFT calculations), which show diminished emission at acidic pH but intensified emission at neutral/basic pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PET (fluorophore as the electron acceptor) sensors, e.g., 2, which shows intensified emission at acidic pH but diminished emission at neutral pH. The fluorescence modulation efficiency of the d-PET effect of the new sensors, i.e., the emission intensity enhancement upon switching from acidic pH to neutral pH, is up to 10-fold, which is greatly improved compared to our previous d-PET sensors (ca. 3-fold). The efficient d-PET effect of the new sensors is attributed to the proper orientation of the electron donor/acceptor; i.e., the dipole moment and the transition moment (the direction of PET) of the new sensors are oriented in the same direction, and the dipole moment values of the new sensors along the vector direction of the PET are larger than that of the reported d-PET sensors. Selective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxyl carboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid, was achieved with the d-PET sensors, and a novel fluorescence transduction profile of enhancement/ diminishment for chemoselectivity was observed.

The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm\u2212Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (kET, Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6. The effect of pH as well as the bonding with analytes on the emission of the sensors were rationalized using DFT/TDDFT calculations. We believe that rational sensor design aided by DFT/TDDFT calculations as well as using free energy changes and electron transfer rate constants to study the emission properties of PeT sensors will become an essential tool in the design of new fluorophores or fluorescent sensors with predetermined photophysical properties.", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, P.O.

To unravel this complex behavior, we have examined the effects of surfactant loading on the interlayer structure and sorption behaviors of organoclays using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The sorption behavior of phenol on three cetyltrimethylammonium intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mt) with CTMA loading levels of 0.33, 1.0, and 1.66 times of the Mt's cation exchange capacity (CEC), was studied. The results demonstrated that CTMA aggregates were the main sorption domains for phenol molecules, consistent with a partition process. The interlayer structure of CTMA-Mt influences the sorption affinity of phenol. CTMA aggregates increased in size with increasing loading level, creating larger sorption domains for phenol uptake. On the other hand, high CTMA loading level decreased the sorption affinity of CTMA-Mt (with 1.66 CEC loading) toward phenol by increasing the packing density and cohesive characteristic of the aggregates. In addition, the siloxane surfaces of Mt and the hydrated inorganic ions (Ca2+ or Br\u2212) showed specific interactions with phenol molecules by forming H-bond. The oxygen atoms on siloxane surface and water molecules around Br\u2212 serve as H-bond acceptor while water molecules around Ca2+ serve as H-bond donor, corresponding to polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) results. The modelling results correlate well with the experimental findings, and further reveal that the sorption affinity strongly depends on the size and packing density of surfactant aggregates. In addition, H-bond interactions should be considered as well in the sorption of OCs containing particular groups.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mineral Physics and Material Research & Development, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                "], "authors": ["H He", "J Zhu", "SC Parker", "R Zhu", "M Molinari", "Q Zhou"], "date": "21 May 2015"},

The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without damage to the electrode surface. The electrode is immersed into aqueous electrolyte media, and voltammetric responses for the oxidation of DDPD are obtained. In order to further improve the current responses, 20\u2005wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array. Voltammetric signals are consistent with the oxidation of DDPD and the associated transfer of perchlorate anions (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M NaClO4) or the transfer of protons (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M HClO4). From the magnitude of the current response, the DDPD content in the mineral oil can be determined down to less than 1\u2005wt% levels. Perhaps surprisingly, the reversible (or midpoint) potential for the DDPD oxidation in mineral oil (when immersed in 0.1 NaClO4) is shown to be concentration-dependent and to shift to more positive potential values for more dilute DDPD in mineral oil solutions.

The results indicated that the addition of supported \u03b2-nucleating agent markedly increased the crystallization temperature (Tc) of PP. Increasing the content of supported \u03b2-nucleating agent slightly increased the Tc, but had no influence on the melting temperatures (Tm) of \u03b2-nucleated PP. The Tc and Tm of \u03b2-nucleated PP decreased slightly with increasing the content of the support nano-CaCO3. The effects of scan rates and multiple scans with different Tmelt on the crystallization and melting behavior of PP nucleated by supported \u03b2-nucleating agent are similar to that of PP nucleated by calcium pimelate (CaHA).

We predict a bandgap in the range of 0.9\u20131.2 eV, reconciling the scattered values reported in experiments, and a remarkably low work function (ionisation potential) of 4.2 eV for the (111) surface.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, UK\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London, 20 Gordon Street, London WC1H 0AJ, UK\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Global E3 Institute, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul 120-749, Korea\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     School of Physics, The University of Sydney, Australia\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                "], "authors": ["S Yoo", "A Walsh", "A Soon", "DO Scanlon"], "date": "03 December 2013"},

Thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized with 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold electrodes, and used as a scaffold for DNA aptamer attachment through hybridization of the aptamer overhang (so-called \u201cDNA-directed immobilization aptamer sensors\u201d, DDIAS). In the approach, the complementary DNA aptamer against PSA was assembled by the probe ssDNA onto the electrode to detect PSA; or the probe ssDNA directly hybridized with a complementary DNA aptamer/PSA complex following their pre-incubation in solution, so-called \u2018on-chip\u2019 and \u2018in-solution\u2019 methods, respectively. A double stranded DNA intercalator with a ferrocenyl (Fc) redox marker was synthesized to evaluate the feasibility of the strategy. The results demonstrate that the \u2018in-solution\u2019 method offers a favourable medium (in a homogeneous solution) for the binding between the aptamer and PSA, which shows to be more efficient than the \u2018on-chip\u2019 approach.

There are no mesostructured particles occurring in the CTAB\u2013PEI solution prior to silica addition; however, after the addition of silicate species the hydrolysis and condensation of these species causes the formation of mesophase particles in a very short time, much faster than ordering observed in the film at the interface. The mesophase within the CTAB\u2013PEI\u2013silica particles finally rearranges into a 2D hexagonal ordered structure. With the aid of the previous neutron reflectivity data on films formed at the air/water interface from similar solutions, a formation mechanism for CTAB\u2013PEI\u2013silica films at the air/water interface has been developed.

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GID) measurements indicate that the mesophase geometry of the interfacial films could be controlled to give lamellar, 2D hexagonal, and several cubic phases (Pn3\u0305m, Fm3\u0305m, and Im3\u0305m) by varying the polyelectrolyte molecular weight, polyelectrolyte chemical nature, or the cationic:anionic surfactant molar ratio. On the basis of GID results, a phase diagram for the catanionic surfactant/polyelectrolyte/TMOS film system was drawn. These films can be easily removed from the interface and mesoporous silica films which retain the film geometry can be obtained after calcination; moreover, this film preparation method provides a simple way to impart polymer functionality into the mesostructured silica wall, which means these films have potential applications in a variety of fields such as catalysis, molecular separation, and drug delivery.", "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of\r\nBath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["KJ Edler", "B Yang", "JA Holdaway"], "date": "26 February 2013"},

Both the band-gap and valence-band maximum (VBM) deformation potentials of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe in the B3 structure were analyzed, revealing a less negative band-gap deformation potential from ZnTe to MgTe to CdTe, with a VBM deformation potential increase from CdTe to ZnTe to MgTe. The natural band offsets were calculated taking into account the core-level deformation. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B3 structure is found to be stable over all (Zn,Cd)Te compositions, as expected from the preferences of ZnTe and CdTe. However, the (Mg,Zn)Te alloy undergoes a B3 to B4 transition above 88% Mg concentration and a B4 to B8 transition above 95% Mg concentration.

Protein microarrays have demonstrated to be cost-effective, high through-put and powerful tools for screening and identifying tumor markers with only minute samples. Autoantibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were shown to be relevant tumor markers. However, due to the variability of immune response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer, detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA autoantibody detection. Herein a panel of 10 proteins, including well-known tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and potential new biomarkers of breast cancer, were immobilized onto microstructured microarray under optimized conditions (spotting pH buffer, surface chemistry, blocking procedure), in order to determine an autoimmune signature of breast cancer. Sera from 29 breast cancer patients and 28 healthy donors were screened in sandwich immunoassays on the miniaturized system to detect the eventual presence of anti-TAAs autoantibodies. Results indicated that the detection level of each anti-TAA autoantibody in a given serum sample was strongly dependant on the surface chemistry.

Films made from the composites were used as scattering layers in DSSCs. The influence of meso-TiO2 proportion on the structure, morphology, and optical properties of the films were investigated. The results show that the films became more porous, with a larger surface roughness, and had higher surface areas and greater light-scattering effects when meso-TiO2 was incorporated. The performance of these scattering layers in relatively large, 1 cm2 area, DSSCs was studied to link cell performance to the detailed physical properties of the meso-TiO2/nanoparticle films.

In this work, we reported a transverse etching process to investigate the morphological variations of single gold nanorods (GNRs). Dark-field microscopy and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy were used as complementary technologies to track the transverse etching process. Dark-field imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution could easily monitor the transverse etching process of GNRs in situ and in real time. Interactions between the scattering spectrum and the morphological variations were judiciously calculated within the dipole approximation by the Drude function. The calculated peak shift of GNRs (\u0394\u03bbmax = 17 nm) was obtained via the ratio of the long axis and short axis (aspect ratio) of GNRs from transmission electron microscopy. The average scattering peak shift (\u0394\u03bbmax = 22 nm) from Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy was in good agreement with the calculated peak shift.

In this study, we have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions were evaluated for the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that the biological activities of the immobilized antibodies were dependent on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Optimal immobilization conditions were different for each antibody. Limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10\u00a0pM can reach under optimized conditions.

Polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles containing covalently bound fluorescein methacrylate and dispersed Nile Red were prepared by emulsion polymerization. The two fluorophores differentiate the fate of the polymeric vehicle on and within the skin from that of the active. Nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. In vitro skin permeation experiments were performed using dermatomed porcine skin. Post-treatment with nanoparticle formulations, the skin surface was either cleaned carefully with buffer or simply dried with tissue, and then immediately visualized by confocal microscopy. Average nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Confocal images showed that nanoparticles were located in skin \u201cfurrows\u201d and around hair follicles. Surface cleaning removed the former but not all of the latter. At the skin surface, Nile Red remained partly associated with nanoparticles, but was also released to some extent and penetrated into deeper layers of the stratum corneum (SC). In summary, polymeric nanoparticles did not penetrate beyond the superficial SC, showed some affinity for hair follicles, and released an associated \u201cactive\u201d into the skin.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); topical drug delivery", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

The thiophene moiety was used to extend the \u03c0-conjugation framework of the fluorophore in order to red-shift the fluorescence emission and, at the same time, to enhance the novel process where the fluorophore serves as the electron donor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (d-PET) of the boronic acid sensors; i.e., the background fluorescence of the sensor 1 at acidic pH is weaker compared to that at neutral or basic pH, in stark contrast to the typical a-PET boronic acid sensors (where the fluorophore serves as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process). The benefit of the d-PET boronic acid sensors is that the recognition of the hydroxylic acids can be achieved at acidic pH. We found that the thiophene moiety is an efficient \u03c0-conjugation linker and electron donor; as a result, the d-PET contrast ratio of the sensors upon variation of the pH is improved 10-fold when compared to the previously reported d-PET sensors without the thiophene moiety. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved at acid pH, and the enantioselectivity (total response KdIFd/KlIFl) is 3.3. The fluorescence enhancement (IFSample/IFBlank) of sensor 1 upon binding with tartaric acid is 3.5-fold at pH 3.0. With the fluorescent bisboronic acid sensor 1, enantioselective recognition of mandelic acid was achieved for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mandelic acid has been enantioselectively recognized using a chiral fluorescent boronic acid sensor. Chiral monoboronic acid sensor 2 and bisboronic acid sensor 3 without the thiophene moiety failed to enantioselectively recognize mandelic acid. Our findings with the thiophene-incorporated boronic acid sensors will be important for the design of d-PET fluorescent sensors for the enantioselective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxylic acids such as mandelic acid, given that it is currently a challenge to recognize these analytes with boronic acid fluorescent molecular sensors.", "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, U.

Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off\u2013on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma. The tumor-targeting ability and the specific drug release in tumors make DCM-S-CPT as a promising prodrug, providing significant advances toward deeper understanding and exploration of theranostic drug-delivery systems.", "affiliations": ["\u2020 Key\r\nLaboratory for Advanced Materials and Institute of Fine Chemicals,\r\nShanghai Key Laboratory of Functional Materials Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, China", "\u2021 Key\r\nLaboratory of Biomass Chemical Engineering of Ministry of Education,\r\nCenter for Bionanoengineering, and Department of Chemical and Biological\r\nEngineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310027, China", "\u22a5 Department\r\nof Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["J Tang", "X Wu", "H Tian", "TD James", "Y Shen", "X Sun", "Z Guo", "W Zhu"], "date": "13 February 2014"},

PS-HEMA copolymer nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, via the covalent incorporation of a small quantity of fluorescein methacrylate, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR. The fluorophore, Nile Red, was dispersed into the nanoparticles and its loading was determined by ultracentrifugation. Skin uptake was assessed in vitro following a 6 h application of the nanoparticle formulation, via stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping and confocal microscopy. Nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Progressive introduction of HEMA decreased particle hydrophobicity and reduced Nile Red loading. Uptake of Nile Red into the skin, as assessed both by the amounts extracted from the SC and by confocal microscopy, decreased as the percentage HEMA increased. Confocal microscopy confirmed that nanoparticles could not move beyond the superficial SC, but did show affinity for hair follicle openings. In conclusion, the loading of a lipophilic \u201cactive\u201d into nanoparticles, and its subsequent release when these formulations are applied topically, are sensitive to the composition and relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); tape-stripping", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "P Griffin", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

For almost a decade, efforts have been made to achieve and improve selectivity for given saccharide targets, most notably glucose, by using properly positioned boronic acids, offering multivalent interactions. Incorporation of several boronic acid groups into a covalent framework or non-covalent assembly of boronic acid are two general methods used to create such smart sensors, of which the latter resembles lectin oligomerisation that affords multivalent saccharide-binding architectures.

This modular strategy to assembly chiral sensors alleviated the previous restrictions of chiral boronic acid sensors, for which the chirogenic center, fluorophore, and scaffold were integrated, thus it was difficult to optimize the molecular structures by chemical modifications. We demonstrated the potential of our new strategy by the preparation of a sensor with a larger scaffold. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect is efficient even with a large distance between the N atom and the fluorophore core. Furthermore, the rarely reported donor-PET (d-PET) effect, which was previously limited to carbazole, was extended to phenothiazine fluorophore. The contrast ratio, that is, PET efficiency of the new d-PET sensor, is increased to 8.0, compared to 2.0 with the previous carbazole d-PET sensors. Furthermore, the ethynylated phenothiazine shows longer excitation wavelength (centered at 380\u2005nm) and emission wavelength (492\u2005nm), a large Stokes shift (142\u2005nm), and high fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution (\u03a6=0.48 in MeOH/water, 3:1 v/v). Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved with the new d-PET boronic acid sensors. The enantioselectivity is up to 10 (ratio of the binding constants toward D- and L-tartaric acid, kD/kL). A consecutive fluorescence enhancement/decrease was observed, thus we propose a transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:2 as the analyte concentration increases, which is supported by mass spectra analysis. The boronic acid sensors were used for selective and sensitive recognition of disaccharides and glycosylated steroids (ginsenosides).", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024 (P.R.

A comprehensive co-crystal screen of four fenamic acid derivatives affords a strictly limited number of co-crystals.

For 1, there is a smooth reduction in unit-cell volume of ~20% from ambient pressure to 4.45 GPa, followed by a dramatic reduction in volume that coincides with a 7.7% increase in the b axis length. Above the pressure of 5.38 GPa a smooth volume reduction continues. In contrast, for 2, there is a continuous change in unit-cell volume with an observed space group change from C2/c to P21/c, between the pressures of 4.15 and 5.70 GPa. In the crystals of 1 between 4.45 and 5.38 GPa adjacent molecules slide over each other and the dominant stacking interaction changes from a thiophene\u22efthiophene interaction at 4.45 GPa to a benzothiophene\u22efbenzothiophene interaction at 5.38 GPa and, within each molecule, the benzothiophene groups show a significant reorientation at the phase transition.

The complex is electrochemically stable and strongly absorbing with a molar extinction coefficient at \u03bb(max) = 564 nm of 11700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 (in MeOH). Experimental and computational data indicate that the HOMO, LUMO and electronic excited state energy levels are appropriate for functionality in a DSSC. From cyclic voltammetry the HOMO is estimated to be \u22125.27 eV, as supported by computational work, which locates the HOMO at \u22125.78 eV. From electrochemical, absorption and emission experiments, the MLCT energy levels are expected to be appropriate for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Our computations support this and locate the key MLCT transition at 563 nm. Despite this, the efficiency in DSSCs is extremely low (<0.1%) suggesting that the dye does not inject excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     CINVESTAV IPN, Dept.

Then the results were compared with simulation results of dry CTMA-Mont. The MD simulations show that the CTMA cations form layer structures on siloxane surface and aggregate in the interlayer space. Water molecules can access part of the siloxane surface and form H-bonds with surface oxygen atoms by donating one or two of the hydrogen atoms. Thus, the water molecules close to the surface have a preferred orientation with the dipole pointing towards the surface, while in the interlayer space, the water molecules aggregate to form large clusters. The H-bonds between surface oxygen and water molecules are shown to be slightly weaker than those between water molecules. Although water molecules within interlayer space can form strong H-bonds as in bulk water the number of H-bond for each water molecule is reduced.

This assumption leads to well-known Arrhenius expressions for transport coefficients, and is equivalent to assuming diffusion is a Poisson process. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the low-temperature $B1$, $B3$, and $B4$ AgI polymorphs, we have compared rates of ion hopping with corresponding Poisson distributions to test the assumption of independent hopping in these common structure types. In all cases diffusion is a non-Poisson process, and hopping is strongly correlated in time. In $B1$ the diffusion coefficient can be approximated by an Arrhenius expression, though the physical significance of the parameters differs from that commonly assumed. In low temperature $B3$ and $B4$, diffusion is characterized by concerted motion of multiple ions in short closed loops.

The interaction between DNA and surface-supported model membranes was followed in situ using null ellipsometry, quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, as well as neutron reflectometry. In the presence of Na+ (in the absence of multivalent ions), DNA adopts an extended coil conformation upon adsorption. The solvent content in the adsorbed layer is high, and DNA is positioned on top of the membrane. In the presence of divalent Ca2+, the driving force for the adsorption of DNA is electrostatic, and the adsorbed DNA film is not as dilute as in a solution containing Na+. Cryo-TEM and SANS were further used to investigate the interaction in bulk solution using vesicles as model membrane systems. DNA adsorption could not be identified in the presence of Na+ using SANS, but cryo-TEM indicates the presence of DNA between neighboring unilamellar vesicles.

To examine ionic transport and defect distributions while explicitly accounting for ion-ion correlations and lattice effects, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of a model coherent fluorite heterostructure without any extrinsic defects, with a difference in standard chemical potentials of mobile fluoride ions between phases induced by an external potential. Increasing the offset in fluoride ion standard chemical potentials across the internal interfaces decreases the activation energies for ionic conductivity and diffusion and strongly enhances fluoride ion mobilities and defect concentrations near the heterostructure interfaces. Non-charge-neutral ``space-charge'' regions, however, extend only a few atomic spacings from the interface, suggesting a continuum model may be inappropriate. Defect distributions are qualitatively inconsistent with the predictions of the continuum mean-field model, and indicate strong lattice-mediated defect-defect interactions.

Aryl ethynyl groups are attached at the 3,6-position of carbazole (aryl = 4-dimethylaminophenyl for sensor 1 or phenyl for sensor 2). Sensor 3 is without 3,6-substitutions. The phenylboronic acid moiety is attached at the 9-position (N-atom) of the carbazole in these sensors. We found that 1 and 3 are d-PET sensors (fluorophore as the electron donor, supported by DFT/TDDFT calculations), which show diminished emission at acidic pH but intensified emission at neutral/basic pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PET (fluorophore as the electron acceptor) sensors, e.g., 2, which shows intensified emission at acidic pH but diminished emission at neutral pH. The fluorescence modulation efficiency of the d-PET effect of the new sensors, i.e., the emission intensity enhancement upon switching from acidic pH to neutral pH, is up to 10-fold, which is greatly improved compared to our previous d-PET sensors (ca. 3-fold). The efficient d-PET effect of the new sensors is attributed to the proper orientation of the electron donor/acceptor; i.e., the dipole moment and the transition moment (the direction of PET) of the new sensors are oriented in the same direction, and the dipole moment values of the new sensors along the vector direction of the PET are larger than that of the reported d-PET sensors. Selective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxyl carboxylic acids, such as tartaric acid, was achieved with the d-PET sensors, and a novel fluorescence transduction profile of enhancement/ diminishment for chemoselectivity was observed.

To unravel this complex behavior, we have examined the effects of surfactant loading on the interlayer structure and sorption behaviors of organoclays using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The sorption behavior of phenol on three cetyltrimethylammonium intercalated montmorillonite (CTMA-Mt) with CTMA loading levels of 0.33, 1.0, and 1.66 times of the Mt's cation exchange capacity (CEC), was studied. The results demonstrated that CTMA aggregates were the main sorption domains for phenol molecules, consistent with a partition process. The interlayer structure of CTMA-Mt influences the sorption affinity of phenol. CTMA aggregates increased in size with increasing loading level, creating larger sorption domains for phenol uptake. On the other hand, high CTMA loading level decreased the sorption affinity of CTMA-Mt (with 1.66 CEC loading) toward phenol by increasing the packing density and cohesive characteristic of the aggregates. In addition, the siloxane surfaces of Mt and the hydrated inorganic ions (Ca2+ or Br\u2212) showed specific interactions with phenol molecules by forming H-bond. The oxygen atoms on siloxane surface and water molecules around Br\u2212 serve as H-bond acceptor while water molecules around Ca2+ serve as H-bond donor, corresponding to polyparameter linear free energy relationships (pp-LFERs) results. The modelling results correlate well with the experimental findings, and further reveal that the sorption affinity strongly depends on the size and packing density of surfactant aggregates. In addition, H-bond interactions should be considered as well in the sorption of OCs containing particular groups.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory of Mineralogy and Metallogeny, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK\r\n                                                    ", "\r\n                                                     University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Mineral Physics and Material Research & Development, Guangzhou 510640, China\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                "], "authors": ["H He", "J Zhu", "SC Parker", "R Zhu", "M Molinari", "Q Zhou"], "date": "21 May 2015"},

The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm\u2212Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (kET, Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6. The effect of pH as well as the bonding with analytes on the emission of the sensors were rationalized using DFT/TDDFT calculations. We believe that rational sensor design aided by DFT/TDDFT calculations as well as using free energy changes and electron transfer rate constants to study the emission properties of PeT sensors will become an essential tool in the design of new fluorophores or fluorescent sensors with predetermined photophysical properties.", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, P.O.

The robust diamond surface allows pore filling, cleaning, and reuse without damage to the electrode surface. The electrode is immersed into aqueous electrolyte media, and voltammetric responses for the oxidation of DDPD are obtained. In order to further improve the current responses, 20\u2005wt% of carbon nanofibers are co-deposited with the oil into the pore array. Voltammetric signals are consistent with the oxidation of DDPD and the associated transfer of perchlorate anions (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M NaClO4) or the transfer of protons (in aqueous 0.1\u2005M HClO4). From the magnitude of the current response, the DDPD content in the mineral oil can be determined down to less than 1\u2005wt% levels. Perhaps surprisingly, the reversible (or midpoint) potential for the DDPD oxidation in mineral oil (when immersed in 0.1 NaClO4) is shown to be concentration-dependent and to shift to more positive potential values for more dilute DDPD in mineral oil solutions.

Thiolated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) was co-immobilized with 3-mercapto-1-propanol on gold electrodes, and used as a scaffold for DNA aptamer attachment through hybridization of the aptamer overhang (so-called \u201cDNA-directed immobilization aptamer sensors\u201d, DDIAS). In the approach, the complementary DNA aptamer against PSA was assembled by the probe ssDNA onto the electrode to detect PSA; or the probe ssDNA directly hybridized with a complementary DNA aptamer/PSA complex following their pre-incubation in solution, so-called \u2018on-chip\u2019 and \u2018in-solution\u2019 methods, respectively.

Both the band-gap and valence-band maximum (VBM) deformation potentials of MgTe, ZnTe, and CdTe in the B3 structure were analyzed, revealing a less negative band-gap deformation potential from ZnTe to MgTe to CdTe, with a VBM deformation potential increase from CdTe to ZnTe to MgTe. The natural band offsets were calculated taking into account the core-level deformation. Ternary alloy formation was explored through application of the special quasirandom structure method. The B3 structure is found to be stable over all (Zn,Cd)Te compositions, as expected from the preferences of ZnTe and CdTe.

Protein microarrays have demonstrated to be cost-effective, high through-put and powerful tools for screening and identifying tumor markers with only minute samples. Autoantibodies directed against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) were shown to be relevant tumor markers. However, due to the variability of immune response from one individual to another and depending on the type of cancer, detection of only one type of anti-TAA autoantibody is not sufficient to give a reliable and precise diagnosis. It is necessary to use a set of several TAAs for determining specific autoimmune profiles. Therefore, combining various TAAs on different surfaces could improve sensitivity and specificity for anti-TAA autoantibody detection. Herein a panel of 10 proteins, including well-known tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and potential new biomarkers of breast cancer, were immobilized onto microstructured microarray under optimized conditions (spotting pH buffer, surface chemistry, blocking procedure), in order to determine an autoimmune signature of breast cancer. Sera from 29 breast cancer patients and 28 healthy donors were screened in sandwich immunoassays on the miniaturized system to detect the eventual presence of anti-TAAs autoantibodies. Results indicated that the detection level of each anti-TAA autoantibody in a given serum sample was strongly dependant on the surface chemistry.

However, efficient multiparametric analysis remains a challenge due to protein variability. Crucial parameters are the design of stable and reproducible surfaces which maintain biological activity of immobilized proteins. These parameters relate to surface chemistry and to immobilization conditions (printing buffers, washing etc.). In this study, we have developed and characterized various surface chemistries for the immobilization of anti-tumor antigen antibodies onto microstructured glass slides. The effect of surface properties and antibody immobilization conditions were evaluated for the detection of tumor antigens involved in colorectal cancer. Experimental results demonstrated that the biological activities of the immobilized antibodies were dependent on the surface chemistry and on the immobilization procedure. Optimal immobilization conditions were different for each antibody. Limit of detection in tumor antigen as low as 10\u00a0pM can reach under optimized conditions. Our 3D microstructured chip offers the possibility to implement a customized multiplex immunoassay combining optimal immobilization condition for each antibody-antigen system on the same chip.", "affiliations": ["bioM\u00e9rieux, D\u00e9partement bioMarqueurs, Marcy l\u2019\u00e9toile 69280, France", "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Institut des Nanotechnologies de Lyon (INL) \u2013 UMR CNRS 5270, Ecole Centrale de Lyon, 36 Avenue Guy de Collongue, Ecully 69134, France"], "authors": ["Y Ataman-\u00d6nal", "E Laurenceau", "G Choquet-Kastylevsky", "E Souteyrand", "Z Yang", "Y Chevolot"], "date": "28 November 2011"},

In this work, we reported a transverse etching process to investigate the morphological variations of single gold nanorods (GNRs). Dark-field microscopy and Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy were used as complementary technologies to track the transverse etching process. Dark-field imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution could easily monitor the transverse etching process of GNRs in situ and in real time. Interactions between the scattering spectrum and the morphological variations were judiciously calculated within the dipole approximation by the Drude function. The calculated peak shift of GNRs (\u0394\u03bbmax = 17 nm) was obtained via the ratio of the long axis and short axis (aspect ratio) of GNRs from transmission electron microscopy. The average scattering peak shift (\u0394\u03bbmax = 22 nm) from Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy was in good agreement with the calculated peak shift. Monitoring the morphological variations of single GNRs enables us to track the transverse etching of GNRs at arbitrary time. This promises to be a useful method for the study of different nanomaterials and their spectral properties.\r    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Department of Chemistry, The University of Western Ontario, 1151 Richmond Street, London, Canada N6A 5B7\r\n                                                    \r\n                                                    \r\n                                                ", "\r\n                                                     Key Laboratory for Advanced Materials & Department of Chemistry, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai 200237, P.

Polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles containing covalently bound fluorescein methacrylate and dispersed Nile Red were prepared by emulsion polymerization. The two fluorophores differentiate the fate of the polymeric vehicle on and within the skin from that of the active. Nanoparticles were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR spectroscopy. In vitro skin permeation experiments were performed using dermatomed porcine skin. Post-treatment with nanoparticle formulations, the skin surface was either cleaned carefully with buffer or simply dried with tissue, and then immediately visualized by confocal microscopy. Average nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Confocal images showed that nanoparticles were located in skin \u201cfurrows\u201d and around hair follicles. Surface cleaning removed the former but not all of the latter. At the skin surface, Nile Red remained partly associated with nanoparticles, but was also released to some extent and penetrated into deeper layers of the stratum corneum (SC). In summary, polymeric nanoparticles did not penetrate beyond the superficial SC, showed some affinity for hair follicles, and released an associated \u201cactive\u201d into the skin.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); topical drug delivery", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

Boronic acids follow lectin functions not just in being able to bind saccharides, but in multivalent saccharide binding that enhances both affinity and selectivity. For almost a decade, efforts have been made to achieve and improve selectivity for given saccharide targets, most notably glucose, by using properly positioned boronic acids, offering multivalent interactions. Incorporation of several boronic acid groups into a covalent framework or non-covalent assembly of boronic acid are two general methods used to create such smart sensors, of which the latter resembles lectin oligomerisation that affords multivalent saccharide-binding architectures.

The thiophene moiety was used to extend the \u03c0-conjugation framework of the fluorophore in order to red-shift the fluorescence emission and, at the same time, to enhance the novel process where the fluorophore serves as the electron donor of the photoinduced electron transfer process (d-PET) of the boronic acid sensors; i.e., the background fluorescence of the sensor 1 at acidic pH is weaker compared to that at neutral or basic pH, in stark contrast to the typical a-PET boronic acid sensors (where the fluorophore serves as the electron acceptor of the photoinduced electron transfer process). The benefit of the d-PET boronic acid sensors is that the recognition of the hydroxylic acids can be achieved at acidic pH. We found that the thiophene moiety is an efficient \u03c0-conjugation linker and electron donor; as a result, the d-PET contrast ratio of the sensors upon variation of the pH is improved 10-fold when compared to the previously reported d-PET sensors without the thiophene moiety. Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved at acid pH, and the enantioselectivity (total response KdIFd/KlIFl) is 3.3. The fluorescence enhancement (IFSample/IFBlank) of sensor 1 upon binding with tartaric acid is 3.5-fold at pH 3.0. With the fluorescent bisboronic acid sensor 1, enantioselective recognition of mandelic acid was achieved for the first time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the mandelic acid has been enantioselectively recognized using a chiral fluorescent boronic acid sensor. Chiral monoboronic acid sensor 2 and bisboronic acid sensor 3 without the thiophene moiety failed to enantioselectively recognize mandelic acid. Our findings with the thiophene-incorporated boronic acid sensors will be important for the design of d-PET fluorescent sensors for the enantioselective recognition of \u03b1-hydroxylic acids such as mandelic acid, given that it is currently a challenge to recognize these analytes with boronic acid fluorescent molecular sensors.", "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, U.

PS-HEMA copolymer nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled, via the covalent incorporation of a small quantity of fluorescein methacrylate, and characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy and NMR. The fluorophore, Nile Red, was dispersed into the nanoparticles and its loading was determined by ultracentrifugation. Skin uptake was assessed in vitro following a 6 h application of the nanoparticle formulation, via stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping and confocal microscopy. Nanoparticle diameters were below 100 nm. Progressive introduction of HEMA decreased particle hydrophobicity and reduced Nile Red loading. Uptake of Nile Red into the skin, as assessed both by the amounts extracted from the SC and by confocal microscopy, decreased as the percentage HEMA increased. Confocal microscopy confirmed that nanoparticles could not move beyond the superficial SC, but did show affinity for hair follicle openings. In conclusion, the loading of a lipophilic \u201cactive\u201d into nanoparticles, and its subsequent release when these formulations are applied topically, are sensitive to the composition and relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.Keywords:  Nanoparticles; skin; laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM); tape-stripping", "affiliations": ["Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K., and Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Claverton Down, Bath, BA2 7AY, U.K."], "authors": ["GJ Price", "P Griffin", "X Wu", "RH Guy"], "date": "12 August 2009"},

Near infrared (NIR) fluorescence-active fluorophores with excellent photostability are preferable for tracking drug release in vivo. Herein, we describe a NIR prodrug DCM-S-CPT and its polyethylene glycol\u2013polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) loaded nanoparticles as a potent cancer therapy. We have conjugated a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran derivative as the NIR fluorophore with camptothecin (CPT) as the anticancer drug using a disulfide linker. In vitro experiments verify that the high intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentrations in tumor cells cause cleavage of the disulfide linker, resulting in concomitantly the active drug CPT release and significant NIR fluorescence turn-on with large Stokes shift (200 nm). The NIR fluorescence of DCM-S-CPT at 665 nm with fast response to GSH can act as a direct off\u2013on signal reporter for the GSH-activatable prodrug. Particularly, DCM-S-CPT possesses much better photostability than ICG, which is highly desirable for in situ fluorescence-tracking of cancer chemotherapy. DCM-S-CPT has been successfully utilized for in vivo and in situ tracking of drug release and cancer therapeutic efficacy in living animals by NIR fluorescence. DCM-S-CPT exhibits excellent tumor-activatable performance when intravenously injected into tumor-bearing nude mice, as well as specific cancer therapy with few side effects. DCM-S-CPT loaded in PEG-PLA nanoparticles shows even higher antitumor activity than free CPT, and is also retained longer in the plasma.

This modular strategy to assembly chiral sensors alleviated the previous restrictions of chiral boronic acid sensors, for which the chirogenic center, fluorophore, and scaffold were integrated, thus it was difficult to optimize the molecular structures by chemical modifications. We demonstrated the potential of our new strategy by the preparation of a sensor with a larger scaffold. The photoinduced electron-transfer (PET) effect is efficient even with a large distance between the N atom and the fluorophore core. Furthermore, the rarely reported donor-PET (d-PET) effect, which was previously limited to carbazole, was extended to phenothiazine fluorophore. The contrast ratio, that is, PET efficiency of the new d-PET sensor, is increased to 8.0, compared to 2.0 with the previous carbazole d-PET sensors. Furthermore, the ethynylated phenothiazine shows longer excitation wavelength (centered at 380\u2005nm) and emission wavelength (492\u2005nm), a large Stokes shift (142\u2005nm), and high fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution (\u03a6=0.48 in MeOH/water, 3:1 v/v). Enantioselective recognition of tartaric acid was achieved with the new d-PET boronic acid sensors. The enantioselectivity is up to 10 (ratio of the binding constants toward D- and L-tartaric acid, kD/kL). A consecutive fluorescence enhancement/decrease was observed, thus we propose a transition of the binding stoichiometry from 1:1 to 1:2 as the analyte concentration increases, which is supported by mass spectra analysis. The boronic acid sensors were used for selective and sensitive recognition of disaccharides and glycosylated steroids (ginsenosides).", "affiliations": ["State Key Laboratory of Fine Chemicals, School of Chemical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian 116024 (P.R.

For 1, there is a smooth reduction in unit-cell volume of ~20% from ambient pressure to 4.45 GPa, followed by a dramatic reduction in volume that coincides with a 7.7% increase in the b axis length. Above the pressure of 5.38 GPa a smooth volume reduction continues. In contrast, for 2, there is a continuous change in unit-cell volume with an observed space group change from C2/c to P21/c, between the pressures of 4.15 and 5.70 GPa. In the crystals of 1 between 4.45 and 5.38 GPa adjacent molecules slide over each other and the dominant stacking interaction changes from a thiophene\u22efthiophene interaction at 4.45 GPa to a benzothiophene\u22efbenzothiophene interaction at 5.38 GPa and, within each molecule, the benzothiophene groups show a significant reorientation at the phase transition. In 2 there is a loss of molecular symmetry, concomitant with the change in space group, at the phase transition with the asymmetric unit changing from containing half a unique molecule to two independent molecules.

In the sulfamate-containing series, compounds containing a naphthalene ring are both the most potent AI (39, IC50\u2009AROM=0.25\u2005nM) and the best STS inhibitor (31, IC50\u2009STS=26\u2005nM). The most promising DASI is 39 (IC50\u2009AROM=0.25\u2005nM, IC50\u2009STS=205\u2005nM), and this was evaluated orally in\u2005vivo at 10\u2005mg\u2009kg\u22121, showing potent inhibition of aromatase (93\u2009%) and STS (93\u2009%) after 3\u2005h. Potent aromatase and STS inhibition can thus be achieved with a DASI containing a bicyclic ring system; development of such a DASI could provide an attractive new option for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer.", "affiliations": ["Endocrinology and Metabolic Medicine and Sterix Ltd., Imperial College London, Faculty of Medicine, St. Mary's Hospital, London, W2\u20051NY (UK)", "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology and Sterix Ltd.

Two alternative options for describing the shape of the solute cavity within the widely used polarized continuum model for implicit solvation were compared; the UFF and UA0 methods give equilibrium isotope effects (EIEs) that vary as a function of the dielectric constant in opposite directions. The same isotope effect was also obtained as the average over 40 structures from a hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical molecular dynamics simulation for the methyl cation explicitly solvated by many water molecules; the inverse value of the EIE agrees with UFF but not UA0. The opposing trends may be satisfactorily explained in terms of the different degrees of exposure of the atomic charges to the dielectric continuum in cavities of different shapes.", "affiliations": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, United Kingdom"], "authors": ["PB Wilson", "IH Williams", "IR Greig", "PJ Weaver"], "date": "17 July 2014"},

The complex is electrochemically stable and strongly absorbing with a molar extinction coefficient at \u03bb(max) = 564 nm of 11700 M\u22121 cm\u22121 (in MeOH). Experimental and computational data indicate that the HOMO, LUMO and electronic excited state energy levels are appropriate for functionality in a DSSC. From cyclic voltammetry the HOMO is estimated to be \u22125.27 eV, as supported by computational work, which locates the HOMO at \u22125.78 eV. From electrochemical, absorption and emission experiments, the MLCT energy levels are expected to be appropriate for electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band. Our computations support this and locate the key MLCT transition at 563 nm. Despite this, the efficiency in DSSCs is extremely low (<0.1%) suggesting that the dye does not inject excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.\r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                        \r                                                    \r                                                    \r                                                ", "affiliations": ["\r\n                                                     CINVESTAV IPN, Dept.

The parallel application of advanced computational methods to the understanding of molecular structure in the solid state has also formed an important strand of this work.
