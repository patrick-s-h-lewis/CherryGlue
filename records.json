We present a detailed protocol for high level 13C enrichment even in slow turnover murine biomaterials (fur keratin), using a customized diet supplemented with commercial labelled algal hydrolysate and formulated as a gel to minimize wastage, which female mice consumed during pregnancy and lactation. This procedure produced approximately eightfold higher fur keratin labelling in pups, exposed in utero and throughout life to label, than in adults exposed for the same period, showing both the effectiveness, and necessity, of this approach.", "affiliations": ["Central Biomedical Resources, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge", "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge", "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital, University of Cambridge"], "authors": ["WY Chow", "DG Reid", "VWC Wong", "MJ Duer", "M Green", "R Rajan", "RA Brooks"], "date": "01 October 2015"},
